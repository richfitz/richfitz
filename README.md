### :wave: Hi, I'm Rich

I work at the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/), Imperial College London, as head of the [RESIDE](https://reside-ic.github.io) research software engineering research.

Most projects in my personal namespace are either historical and/or personal projects that I wrote for fun (e.g. [`rainbowrite`](https://github.com/richfitz/rainbowrite), [`rfiglet`](https://github.com/richfitz/rfiglet) or [`stegasaur`](https://github.com/richfitz/stegasaur). Actively maintained projects here include [`redux`](https://github.com/richfitz/redux) and [`thor`](https://github.com/richfitz/thor).

Most of my current software can be found in the [`mrc-ide`](https://github.com/mrc-ide/), [`vimc`](https://github.com/vimc) and [`reside-ic`](https://github.com/reside-ic) organisations (among others)
